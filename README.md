Search Them All is like a Pokedex<br>
In the search bar you can input a value like a Pokemon Name or his type<br>
With the menu above you can search by a single type <br>
And on the top menu on the left you can choose the language between Italian and English<br>
There are also some bottoms to sort the Pokemon by their Name, Type, or Stats.
